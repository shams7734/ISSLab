	IP spoofing  ************
	
	This activity was performed by

	In this we did IP spoofing using nmap .
	Command used : nmap 192.168.43.22
	In this case the target IP is 192.168.43.22 . We can see the packets using wireshark and tcpdump.
	
	For IP spoofing 
	Command used : nmap -e wlp1s0 -S 172.21.7.53 192.168.43.22
	Spoofed IP   : 172.21.7.53
	Original Ip  : 192.168.43.22
	
	We can visualise this through wireshark as now it shows the packets sent from the spoofed IP
	but the actual sender is someone else.
	I have included the screenshot and the a text file of the packets .
